## Why this blog exists??
This is my digital notebook/page where I write about stuff I have learnt. This blog is mostly a note to myself.

Writing helps me unwind my thoughts and understanding of things in a structured way. It even acts like a logbook for me.

## Inspiration and ideology

I believe in this and wanted to deliver it in writing medium
